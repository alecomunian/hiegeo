Usage
============
This section describe an example useage of `hiegeo`.





Input files
*******************

For properly running `hiereo`, you need two files:

1) A `.JSON` file, that contains info about the discretization grid
   and the rendering of the plots.

2) A data file (`.CSV` format) that include the actual data set, with
   information about the contact points, chronology and hierarchy.

JSON file
------------------

An example `JSON` file is provided in the file `hiegeo_test.json`.


NOTE: In the data-set, the SB starting and ending *x* coordinates
   should be ideally defined starting from the same value for all the
   SBs. Alternatively, one can sligly reduce the size of the grid (in
   this case, a warning message will be printed).
